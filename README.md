Introduction
John and Mary are students of the 3rd. primary grade.
They are the best students and are always vying for class leadership, and to receive compliments and grades they use all the resources.
In addition to the notes, they usually give the teacher fruits.
The teacher, noticing the ruse of the students, decided to intensify the competition.


"Starting today, I will take home only 3 fruits."

John always takes apples and Mary pears. They take as their mothers buy, that is, for days that one of them takes nothing, others that both take several fruits. They even took up to 5 fruits!

"I will take the fruits of both, but the preference will be for the student who has the best grade in the tests.", Said the teacher.

Every day, the teacher made an assessment of the subject of the day before. The next day she checked the best and accepted the gifts according to the established rule and took note of the results in this spreadsheet.
